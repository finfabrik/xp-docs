# Executive Summary

**Background: Digital Asset-Backed Securities are emerging** 

The cryptoassets revolution holds the promise to add a new chapter to capital markets as a new asset class. Cryptocurrencies are one group in 
this class and are just the beginning of a broader development. We foresee the emergence of a significantly more consequential group: 
Digital Asset-Backed Securities (DABS) which represent ownership in both tangible and intangible assets on a blockchain protocol.  

The emergence of DABS as the broader group of security tokens will drive a development towards unlocking trillions of US dollars of trapped liquidity, 
significantly increase traded exchange volumes and income from new products based on digital assets. 

This hypothesis is based specifically on the qualities that are added to an underlying alternative and typically illiquid asset via the process of tokenisation. 
These qualities bring significant benefits for both the supply and demand side in assets markets. 

We consider it as critical for the healthy development of the security token movement to bring established institutional players to this evolving asset class. 
Professional systems and services are fundamental to fulfil this requirement. 

**Project: CrossPool as one venue for origination, listing and trading services for security tokens**

CrossPool captures this opportunity by creating one venue that provides professional investors with origination, listing and trading services in security tokens. 
The solution differentiates in several ways: 

- Built on our long-standing capital markets expertise and technology solutions used by cryptoassets businesses today. 

- Integrated ecosystem from origination/ token creation to listing, trading and market making. 

- Hybrid exchange design, matching orders on centralised orderbooks to avoid the block time latency yet settling trades on blockchain to take advantage of transaction finality. 

- Embedded secure distributed storage system with access control to cover specific data storage needs such as legal and ownership documents for underlying assets. 

- A binary security token model with private and public state to allow both: privacy, auditability and traceability via notary nodes as well as broader public circulation and Dapps usage.

**Token: CrossPool Utility Token (XPU) is powering use of the platform**  

XPU is a utility token designed to support the core services on the CrossPool platform. The token can be used to pay for services such as asset origination, listing and trading fees. 
XPU will be brought into initial circulation via a private offering.

**Team: long-standing capital markets technology expertise**  

CrossPool is developed by FinFabrik, a financial technology firm based in Hong Kong. The team shows a strong track record in capital markets, with deep expertise in the area of wealth management, 
blockchain technology, trading operations and software development.

# 1. Market overview 

It has been a decade since the birth of bitcoin, the digital currency that has revolutionised global financial markets. A rapidly growing number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and 
the extensive media coverage around it has led to the development of multiple cryptoassets. In the past few years, over 2,000 cryptoassets have emerged, while it will take time and 
market maturity for some of them to become mainstream, operating within capital markets concepts and rules is a precondition to extend this niche to broader distribution and adoption.

## 1.1 Industry background and vision

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, constitute the earliest and best-known
examples of cryptoassets, but the space continues to grow and evolve. The current number
of cryptoassets is 2003 with many new coins and tokens emerging almost on a daily basis.

One important characteristic of the fast-growing cryptoassets market is the fluidity in the
terminology used to describe assets within this subclass, while a common classification is
required, and further progress is anticipated in this area. Currently there is not a general
consensus for the classification of cryptoassets.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a subclass of the cryptoasset family and together with
platform tokens, utility tokens, security tokens and Digital Asset-Backed Securities (DABS)
represent the full spectrum of the cryptoasset environment.

Unlike traditional asset classes cryptoassets are subject to network effects created by the
community around them [1]. The result is a strong force of concentration that we do not see in
other asset classes. Ultimately this drive leads to an oligopoly of a few cryptocurrencies
dominating the entire market. Bitcoin the oldest asset of this emerging class accounts for
52% 2 of the total market share (USD 112 Billion).

Looking at the broader capital markets, cryptocurrencies represent around 0.6% of the current 
global market capitalisation of traditional assets. To grow this new asset class to a more substantial 
size, several factors will play a determining role. One is the emergence of further sub-classes within 
cryptoassets. The class of DABS will show considerably higher market capitalisation and have the potential 
to tap into around USD 330 trillion of trapped liquidity.

<p  style="text-align:center">
 <img src="../../images/fig-1.png" /> 
 <em>Market capitalisation by asset classes (USD)</em>
</p>
 
Regulatory reforms will be another essential factor for further progress. The conjunction of
regulatory initiatives by the authorities and the push of the industry in terms of standardization
and definition of best practices will solve the current legal vacuum in which many of the
transactions are taking place.

In term of regulations there is still a very diverse treatment across geographies. In 48 countries
cryptoassets are regulated, regulations include the application of tax and Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) laws and/or regulation of fundraising activities by ICOs and operation of
digital exchanges.

Some countries are seeking to go even further and are in the process of issuing their own
national cryptocurrency, these include Venezuela, Ireland and eight islands in the eastern
Caribbean.

In spite of the regulatory restrictions introduced by China, that has imposed an implicit ban to
any cryptocurrency related activities. Asia is considered one the most advanced regions in
terms of regulations. In Japan, bitcoin is recognized as legal tender and cryptocurrency
exchanges can operate under the supervision of Japan’s financial agency. Other countries
such as Kazakhstan and Singapore have been taking steps to create the conditions to
encourage the development of a cryptoassets market within a newly defined regulatory
framework.

In Kazakhstan, the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) has position itself as the
financial hub for the Central Asia region. The AIFC enjoys a special legal regime envisioned by
English constitutional law, it follows recognized financial standards for regulations and offers
incentives to companies including the exception from corporate and personal income tax.

The CrossPool exchange will be located within the AIFC. Its progressive policymaking and its
inclusive regulatory framework make it a promising financial hub for the cryptoasset economy
to continue flourishing.

**The way ahead**

Institutional investment will increase thanks to the new investment vehicles that are emerging,
such as the bitcoin futures offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the approval
of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the development of specialized solutions such as
institutional digital asset custody services.

The expansion of Asset-Backed tokens will bring investment opportunities to a broader sector
of the population. We expect to see an increase in investment activity by retail investor. This
will also potentially contribute to greater network effects created around the tokens.

The continued interest to develop these technologies from different perspectives will likely
encourage international collaborations to solidify the regulatory framework surrounding
cryptoassets. We expect to see an increase for global actions by the G20 and a continued
increase of enforcement actions by governments around the world, particularly the United
States and European countries.

The movement towards a decentralized approach of operations will continue, we should see
the consolidations of some digital currencies and the application of a broader range of
blockchain applications.

We expect to see an increase in the issuance of cryptocurrencies by central banks, as
Venezuela [2] has already done, including probably some economically and politically relevant
countries such as Russia or China [3], which will lead to an intensification of regulatory efforts of
digital currencies in other geographies.

The bulk of change will be in the infrastructure to manage transactions. The new versions of
platforms such as Corda, as well as others developed by startups and financial institutions
have detected and corrected errors of these first years of experimentation and we should see
an increase of working productive solutions.

## 1.2 Challenges and opportunities in alternative assets investing
 
The traditional alternative asset investment in capital markets is still characterised by a high
entry barrier for most participants. Furthermore, significant friction in trading processes leads
to illiquid markets, difficulty to invest into a truly diversified portfolio and limited product
innovation. Transversal across these topics lies an additional issue: suboptimal, outdated
systems that are stolid and lack innovation.

With every challenge come opportunities. By leveraging the foundational innovation of
blockchain, applying proven concepts from capital markets practice and bringing a modern
technology stack as part of the solution, significant market potential arises.
The main sources of opportunity we believe are in lowering entry barriers, adding liquidity,
enabling true portfolio diversification and facilitating product innovation.

### 1.2.1 From high barrier of entry to financial inclusion

Getting access to interesting investment instruments in financial markets is regularly
complicated by minimum investment amounts that are prohibitively high for most people.
Even market participants who have the means to invest decide against it, as not to create
concentration risks. This challenge applies in particular to assets that have traditionally shown
significant investment value for diversification and returns, including art, gold, commodities,
real estate or luxury collectibles such as watches and wines.

As an example, the best performing price segment by growth of sale in art across sectors and
geographies has been the highest segment with works valued at USD 10m and above.

<p  style="text-align:center">
 <img src="../../images/fig-2.png" /> 
</p>
 
The price level of this attractive segment is inaccessible for vast majority of the investors, and
similar patterns apply to other collectibles, as well as financial assets such as bonds (high
minimum investment requirements) and other intangible assets like movie rights or patents.

Apart from pure return considerations, the emotional value of some of these investments is an
additional important factor. One reason why collective investment programme like mutual
funds or real estate investment trusts are only partly a solution to this challenge is that they
lack a sense of direct ownership and sentimental attachment. Especially younger investors
value a more direct relationship and experience with the invested asset that is only achievable
via ownership.

Participation barriers not only apply to high-priced alternative assets. Access to plain vanilla
financial products and investable assets is difficult for market participants with only limited
liquid investable assets.

The opportunity lies in unlocking access to a set of assets for a much broader group of
investors. Currently, investment opportunities as mentioned above are preserved for high or
ultra-high net worth individuals, as defined by those with asset holdings of USD1m+. This
represents a very small proportion of the global population (0.7%). 3 By lowering the barrier to
entry, this newly created asset class could potentially tap into the middle and upper-middle
class market, combined this represents about 30% of the global population. Looking at the
middle class alone (as defined by individuals with a net worth between USD 10,000 and USD
100,000), this segment is projected to grow by nearly 230 million adults, exceeding 1.2 billion
adults by 2022, and the aggregate wealth of this group is expected to rise around 20%.

If we view this from an asset diversification perspective, the lower barrier to entry also provides
existing investors a new way to diversify their portfolio, hence achieving outcomes that are
more aligned with their objectives.

With the most fundamental needs being covered, these groups are looking for investment
opportunities with both attractive returns and meaning – satisfied by asset classes just like
laid out above.

### 1.2.2 From low turnover ratio to enhanced liquidity

A challenge in traditional investment markets is illiquidity of assets. Improving liquidity in an
asset offers substantial opportunities and benefits for both supply and demand sides of the
market.

A prototypical example is the trading and investing into real estate which has risen to be the
most valuable asset class in the world as measured by inventory. The total value of global real
estate has reached USD 228 trillion driven by global asset price inflation in the sector. 4 This
makes this asset class more valuable than the combination of all global stocks and securities
debt. To put things into perspective, the total value of all the gold ever mined amounts to little
over USD 7 trillion. 5 In addition to sheer size, real estate is seen as one of the most important
asset classes today also based on its qualities as an investment category, such as being
tangible and capable of generating a dividend stream from rental income.

Looking at these qualities, real estate could be expected to be relatively actively traded and
yet it is broadly defined as an illiquid asset class. In fact, its illiquidity and lumpy nature are
adding to its risk as an asset, perceived and actual, which significantly reduces its
attractiveness for investments.
  
The turnover ratio is one standardised way to measure liquidity of an asset and is defined as
the total traded value of an asset over the value of its total outstanding inventory.

Applying this concept to real estate, the turnover ratio is less than 4%, with an inventory of USD 228 trillion
and the total global value of real estate transactions amounting to roughly USD 8 trillion. 6 Compared to
that, global equities show a turnover ratio of around 100%, i.e. each single stock changes hands around once
a year. 7 This figure is relevant from multiple perspectives. For the businesses engaged in real estate, transactions
provide for a significant part of the income generated in the industry, particularly from a view on relative margins and returns. 
A low turnover on any asset ratio translates into missed opportunities to generate profits on the supply side by providing
services to parties interested in transacting – while at the same time negatively impacting the availability of 
investment opportunities for the demand side. These challenges apply to real estate and equally to other alternative illiquid assets.

<p  style="text-align:center">
 <img src="../../images/fig-3.png"/><br/>
 <em>Total inventory and total traded value of real estate and equities markets</em>
</p>
   
There are significant opportunities in adding liquidity to an asset class and increasing the ease
with which it can be acquired or disposed of. By reducing lumpiness and improving asset
continuity, divisibility and linearity the underlying risk of the asset can be reduced. Additional
benefits are a higher level of pricing transparency and the ability to flexibly sell also smaller
units when required. In line with the earlier discussion around broader participation, more
liquid assets typically show a higher openness for all types of investors and investment
volumes, irrespective of their net worth, investment minimums or accreditation status.

From a markets perspective, improving the turnover ratio of a traditionally less liquid asset can
result in attractive additional volumes in traded inventory. While the fundamental qualities of
illiquid assets like real estate will generally limit the potential to increase liquidity, there is an
argument that by removing some of the inhibiting factors such as prohibitive minimum
investment tickets, high friction in transaction processes and monolithic investment vehicles,
the turnover ratio can be grown substantially. Given the significant proportions of the inventory
capitalisation of real estate, this would bring notable additional business opportunity to this
industry, both on the supply and the demand side. From a demand view, higher liquidity in an
asset means higher availability of investment opportunity. Equally for suppliers, ease of
financing of projects and sustainability of business activities are improved by better liquidity
in the underlying asset.

### 1.2.3 From exclusivity of assets to broadly diversified portfolios

One of the most established and important elements of reaching long-term financial objectives while achieving 
a healthy level of risk is diversification. By allocating investments across a broad range of asset classes and 
financial instruments, industry sectors, geographies and other areas, a suitable balance between risk and return 
for the individual investor can be achieved. A fundamental condition of this approach is access to investable assets 
that show uncorrelated returns, i.e., do not react to the same market events or do not react to these events 
in the same way. 

<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/fig-4.png" />
  <br/>
 <em>Price development of major mainstream asset classes, commodities and fine wines</em>
</p>
  
By adding assets that are conventionally considered alternative, illiquid, hard assets or instruments of direct 
investing, a different grade of diversification can be achieved. This type of diversification may address issues 
like systematic risk in capital markets which is undiversifiable with traditional instruments. Fine wines, for example, 
have been a worthwhile asset class for decades, not primarily for their returns but also for qualities of a 
relatively low volatility and little correlation with mainstream investments. Comparing a representative price index 
of collectible wines against other assets reveals that even in times of strong market movements, this asset class 
remains relatively stable and uncorrelated from broader events. Wine appears to be closer in nature to the price 
movements of commodities and gold, yet showing lower volatility than most. Similar patterns can be observed with assets 
such as classic cars, luxury watches, patents, carbon emission rights or race horses. In addition to the benefits of 
financial diversification, investors typically display a different kind of emotional attachment and importance of 
meaning to these investments – a fact that can be considered a supplementary quality of investing broadly across asset 
classes. Including alternative instruments in a portfolio well diversified with mainstream assets holds significant value. 

The fundamental challenges with crafting a truly diversified portfolio in the context of the above understanding 
are accessibility and exclusivity. In simple terms: diversification to the degree that would be desirable is not 
feasible for most investors and left to wealthy individuals. This is based on the nature of alternatives, 
predominantly a high average price per investable unit, low liquidity, lack of access to deals and high costs of asset 
maintenance. Substitutes of direct investments such as fund structures and direct investment approaches usually come 
at high management cost, have minimum investment amounts of their own and do not solve the problem of illiquidity and 
miss the opportunity to add an emotional connection to the investment. As a result, the average investor and even 
most individuals considered to be part of the upper middle class and lower upper class are excluded from the 
opportunity to create well diversified portfolios. 
   
Looking at this analysis, the opportunities are evident. Providing access to investors to these types of 
assets would provide them with the benefits discussed. A person with USD 10,000 in available liquid assets 
could invest into a diversified portfolio similar to a high net worth individual with USD 10 million in liquidity. 
Comparably, wealth managers and investment advisors would benefit with a broader arsenal of investment alternatives 
for their clients. Finally, asset providers and the overall market in these instruments would greatly benefit from a 
much more extensive participation from a broader group of investors, increasing business opportunity and ability 
to provide services.

### 1.2.4 From limited offerings to product innovation

A challenge that is particularly distinct in alternative assets and also cryptoassets is the limited availability 
of financial products related to or based on these assets for average investors. For most market participants, 
special products like lombard lending or loan collateralisation with collectible items are not offered. 
While the market for art-secured loans has grown to a global value of around USD 20 billion and shown a 
year-on-year growth of more than 10%, there is significant potential for product innovation on a broader basis. 
   
The opportunity to build innovative products on top of a new asset class and new investable instruments 
such as DABS is significant. For an asset owner the benefits could range from releasing capital from their 
asset to enabling models of co-ownership. For financial institutions, the opportunity to engage in 
product innovation has been a fundamental factor of overall industry growth.
   
### 1.2.5 From inadequate systems to professional platforms

As a technology provider we see deficiencies in the current technology stack being in use, the opportunity to provide 
more suitable platforms dedicated to support these instruments well as the chance to continuously 
innovate along the growth trajectory of this new asset class.

As a technology company and as a team we hail from traditional capital markets and bring decades of expertise 
in financial technology. When serving our clients, we regularly see suboptimal system setups at service providers 
and trading venues that do not maintain the standards of professional capital markets systems. 
Two strong hypotheses support our view: firstly, to fulfil the potential of cryptoassets, these need to operate firmly 
within and as part of capital markets. This is the only viable way to arrive at broader distribution to a retail 
clientele as well as engage institutional players that will provide further inflow. Secondly, one major condition to 
integrate with well-established markets is to comply with rules and regulations and also maintain highest standards 
on systems supporting these developments. From a provider perspective there is great opportunity to shape and propel 
this development with innovative technology.

# 2. Digital Asset-Backed Securities and their impact 

Overcoming the challenges and unlocking the opportunities discussed in section 1 can be achieved in many ways. 
The CrossPool project works towards these goals by adopting the latest technology and applying innovative concepts to 
capital markets. The fundamental innovation of blockchain introduced by the advent of Bitcoin continues to serve as a 
launching pad for progressive projects, also changing the nature of capital markets. Here we will discuss in detail 
one area that we find particularly interesting: Digital Asset-Backed Securities, DABS. 

## 2.1 Introduction to DABS

A real asset is defined as a physical object that have value due to its substance. The group include precious metals, 
real estate, commodities and other categories such as luxury goods and collectibles. Real assets can be sold, bought or 
transferred, and given their low correlation to financial assets, they provide an effective way to enhance the diversification 
of traditional portfolios. Their dynamic nature as investment vehicles has made them a preferred investment choice for a 
niche group of investors, yet the market is characterized by low liquidity. 

The transformation of traditional illiquid assets into a security is called securitisation. A security is tradeable and 
therefore more liquid than the underlying asset. While securitisation is effective in converting assets into tradable 
instruments, it comes with significant complexities, including legal procedures, paperwork, long processing times and 
high transaction costs.  

**Digital Asset Backed Securities (DABS)** are the digital representations of real assets on the blockchain or broadly the 
distributed ledger. Tokenisation is the digital process of converting rights to real assets into a token on the blockchain, 
when you assign a digital identity to a real asset you are adding additional qualities to the instrument. Tokenised 
versions of assets that can be traded directly and immediately on digital exchanges, stored on digital wallets and 
exchanged for other asset tokens (DABS) within the same or other asset classes.  

<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/table-1.png" />
</p>

While nomenclature is not settled yet and there are several different terms applied to the same concept, for example 
Security Token [4], in this paper, we will use DABS to refer to this new class of instruments within cryptoassets. 

## 2.2 Key qualities added to assets via tokenisation 
       
A major difference between cryptocurrencies, the original sub-group within cryptoassets, and the newer group DABS is 
that DABS are based on existing assets. These assets have market prices, are typically traded in some form and are created 
and managed using customary procedures and rely on established rules. With tokenisation, certain qualities are added to 
these assets that allow the pursuit of the opportunities discussed earlier. These qualities can be structured following 
a service value chain and enable benefits for both the supply side and demand side for an investable asset. 
       
### 2.2.1 Accessibility 

The majority of alternative and illiquid assets by definition have high minimum investment criteria and ticket sizes for 
the standards of an average investor. For some assets this is by design, for example to ensure only qualified and professional 
investors can engage. Yet, in a significant amount of cases prohibitively high access hurdles are based on an inefficient setup, 
friction in the processes or the simple fact that one unit of an asset has a relatively high price. With tokenisation, 
the ownership of an asset and all legal rights and obligations are digitised. Once there is a digital representation, 
the unit of investment can be easily broken down into smaller elements. Even if the physical ownership certificate of a 
piece of art is represented in one equivalent token, this token can be multiplied into smaller units that all represent 
the same right and all show the same nature of DABS. In effect, ownership of the asset is fractionalised. 

Using the concept of digital fractional ownership, accessibility can be dramatically increased. By offering small 
investment units in a highly efficient and automated way, it becomes feasible and attractive for an asset supplier to 
access wider investor segments. The group of potential investors expands significantly. 

- Benefits for the demand side: Democratisation of investing into assets that are currently reserved for high net worth individuals. 
- Benefits for the supply side: New investment and capital raising models. 
       
### 2.2.2 Tradability 

Once a DABS is created in the form of a token, any use and modification of ownership happens on digital rails. While transactions 
of illiquid and lumpy assets traditionally show significant friction and cost, transferring DABS functions along the lines of 
electronic trading and hence is achieved with high velocity, low cost and low complexity. Acquiring a share in a luxury watch on 
a dedicated exchange from another individual or business becomes as simple and efficient as buying an Apple stock on Nasdaq.  

With this change, the ideal conditions for one of the most important qualities in trading are created: liquidity. Combining 
better general access to the asset for a larger group of people with a highly efficient way of transacting in the asset serves 
as a foundation to improve the turnover ratio of the instrument. An added benefit is a more continuous pricing of the asset which 
can serve as an input to further product innovation. Adding liquidity to any asset adds interesting qualities and dynamics to it 
and provide significant opportunity for the participants in the market.  

- Benefits for the demand side: Ability to trade any asset against any currency or other assets, 24 hours 7 days. 
- Benefits for the supply side: Enhanced liquidity and turnover ratio in currently illiquid assets.
       
### 2.2.3 Investability 

Assets that can be easily originated, accessed and traded in small fractions are highly conducive to the creation of well 
diversified portfolios. In the current capital markets and wealth management environment, truly heterogeneous portfolios 
are only a possibility for high net worth investors with assets that are more liquid. Each alternative asset added to an investment 
basket comes with a significant minimum investment and notable complexity. DABS brings two relevant characteristics in this context: 
small investment tickets and ease of transaction. As a result, even for smaller sums of total investment, very broadly diversified 
portfolios can be constructed. An average investor can acquire direct ownership of fractions artworks, classic cars, wine, watches, 
real estate and other assets, without having to rely on special vehicles and other cost intensive approaches. Provided permissible 
from a regulatory standpoint (e.g., considering suitability factors), alternative and illiquid assets can effectively become part 
of a portfolio of average investors. 

- Benefits for the demand side: Well diversified portfolios even for smaller invested amounts. 
- Benefits for the supply side: To be able to offer asset classes that are previously not possible (due to high transaction costs or operational efficiency etc.) 
       
### 2.2.4 Financial product innovation 

Innovation in financial products, be it evolution of core offerings or transformational innovation involving new types of products, 
has been an important dynamo of growth in the financial services industry. It can be further argued that most innovation brought 
to market was either to satisfy an existing need from clients or bring in new values to them. A further benefit is lower costs of 
services and products and improved levels of service. The creation of new instruments like DABS offer the opportunity of building 
product innovation on top of them. The flexibility of a crypto security created via tokenisation allows a different approach to product 
innovation. One example is the development of lending offerings based on collateralised real assets. A DABS token can be easily held in 
digital escrow by a lender that provides a credit line against the value of the underlying, after applying a haircut. Similar to a margin 
trading agreement, the lender can apply a margin call in case the price of the underlying moves against the borrower. If the margin call 
is not observed by the borrower, the lender can easily liquidate a part of the collateral in a liquid market of DABS. The entire process 
can be fully automated and serve as an efficient and low-cost way of providing immediate liquidity to asset holders. 

- Benefits for the demand side: Narrowing of funding gap supported by digital collateralisation. 
- Benefits for the supply side: Opportunity for product innovation and broadening of services.
    
## 2.3 Example use cases 

We have selected several exemplary use cases, in which we believe asset tokenisation could eliminate or alleviate the key challenges faced 
by investors when trading or/and holding such assets. The selected examples are based on the business opportunities we have in the pipeline, 
and the application could apply to a lot more use cases that are not presented here.

# 3. The CrossPool Platform 

## 3.1 Value proposition and differentiation 

CrossPool is an exchange built on fundamental capital markets concepts to serve professional cryptoasset investors and optimally support origination, listing and trading of DABS.  

For institutional services we foresee demand in trading for both established cryptocurrencies as well as for the new asset class DABS. At its core, CrossPool aims to differentiate 
by combining two dimensions:

### 3.1.1 Professional trading environment for cryptoassets 

CrossPool will be developed by FinFabrik, a technology provider that serves cryptoassets businesses. While there has been significant progress in fundamental protocol infrastructure, 
we noticed that most of the current trading applications on which we and our clients rely are not fulfilling institutional requirements. Apart from operational challenges and 
increasingly complex workflows for businesses, the technical standards of platforms have generally been improving but is broadly not yet on a level to fulfil the requirements of 
capital markets firms and professional users. This refers to multiple elements, including general security and stability of systems, connectivity and reliability of integrations, 
order types, speed and execution solidity. CrossPool builds on our expertise in trading and exchange systems to offer an enterprise-grade alternative. We consider it as critical 
for the healthy development of the security token movement to bring established institutional players to this evolving asset class. Professional systems and services are fundamental 
to fulfil this requirement. 

### 3.1.2 Focus on enabling DABS investment and asset management models 

The industry interest around DABS has been steadily growing and new potential use cases around digitising assets are emerging. A major observable difference recently has been an 
increased interest in the field by institutions and well-established investment firms to explore this innovative approach to alternative investments. There is a need for a 
professional exchange venue to support DABS: this is why we decided to build CrossPool around four core use cases:  

- **Origination:** the creation of representation of ownership in an asset via the process of tokenisation using a blockchain protocol. 
- **Listing:** making cryptocurrencies and DABS available for trading on the platform, including trading cross-assets.  
- **Trading:** bringing together potential buyers and sellers of cryptoassets, supported by active market making and aggregating liquidity from external and alternative venues. Binary-mode tokens will allow free trading in the security on public blockchains and exchanges while enabling ownership transfer of the underlying asset in a secure private-chain environment. 
- **Asset Management:** current projects of FinFabrik indicate a need for segregated private environments used by asset managers, investment firms and fund administrators to enhance and simplify the creation, fundraising, accessibility, ownership transfer and administration of units in investable assets. By creating digital representations of ownership in assets or fund structures, investment and administration processes can be significantly improved, without allowing public trading in the underlying. 

## 3.2 Platform services and usage areas 

In line with the envisaged value proposition, CrossPool encompasses four principal platform services and usage areas for clients and ecosystem members. 

<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/fig-5.png" />
</p>

## 3.3 Platform users and ecosystem 

Participants of the CrossPool platform and its ecosystem around the DABS tokens will include: 

- **Asset Owners:**<br/>
    Firms or individual investors who wish to tokenise their real assets on CrossPool to achieve broader investor access, product innovation and improvement of asset liquidity. 

- **Professional Traders:**<br/>
    Hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and individual traders who utilise CrossPool as the primary exchange to buy and sell cryptoassets for trading and market making purposes and aim to exploit price volatility. 

- **Wealth and Investment Managers:**<br/>

## 3.4 Technical innovation 

### 3.4.1 Hybrid exchange using distributed ledger technology 

There are three types of cryptoasset exchanges in terms of matching and settlement behaviours: centralised exchange, de-centralised exchange and hybrid exchange.  

Centralised exchanges use no blockchain or distributed ledger technology for their core services while de-centralised exchanges fully rely on blockchain for matching and settlement. 
Hybrid exchanges match orders on centralised orderbooks to avoid the block time latency for matching, yet settle the trades on blockchain to take advantage of its transaction finality. 

CrossPool is a hybrid exchange (HEX) fully integrated with Corda. Corda is a blockchain and smart contract platform that allows parties to transact directly, with value. 
Corda is developed by R3 and over its 200 technology and industry partners, and FinFabrik is one of the R3 partners.  

Orders submitted to the CrossPool exchange will be processed and matched by the centralised matching engine. When a trade materialises, the transactions will be shared with all 
counterparties and the system notary. Consensus is achieved when the signatures of the parties involved are presented and transaction is recorded on the 
Corda ledger achieving immediate post trade settlement. 

The hybrid setup of CrossPool improves efficiency and reliability in trading of cryptoassets, including traditional cryptocurrencies as well as DABS. 

### 3.4.2 Embedded secure distributed storage system with access control 

The secure storage of data is a key element of CrossPool. Components of the exchange platform will be distributed globally and deployed on different operating systems or 
clouding servers. For example, Corda nodes can be running on various Linux systems or a Windows system, and these systems could be either located in private data centres, 
on AWS or on Alibaba Cloud. The operational setup of the platform will require that some data is shared across these heterogeneous nodes globally. 
CrossPool serves as a dedicated venue for DABS which brings specific data storage needs beyond a traditional exchange, such as the legal and ownership documentation for 
the underlying assets that are digitised and subsequently linked to the respective token. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks around financial transactions restrict where 
sensitive information shall be retained, eg, customer information may not be permissibly stored remotely in foreign countries but needs to be on local data centres. 
These and other requirements call for a dedicated solution for secure data storage, embedded into the DLT setup of CrossPool. 

Working with the R&D team from a Peking University key lab, the CrossPool exchange will use an embedded secure distributed data storage system developed as an enhancement 
and extension of an existing patent. The approach utilises a file storage system based on Cyber Mimic Defense technology by adding a built-in layer of Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
control to allow files to be shared and accessed securely. This collaboration is an expression of our team’s commitment to research-driven technology development.

### 3.4.3 One token, two states – the binary model 

One of the most valued features of a public blockchain protocol is the anonymity it offers its users. The transaction origination and destination are random unique addresses which can’t 
be specifically traced even though all transactions are recorded and made public. A user can preserve his or her privacy as long as their pseudonym is not linked. Only after the link 
between the identity and the address is established and disclosed, all details about the address become publicly available, including a full transaction history [5]. 

This creates two major issues for the adoption of DLT by financial institutions: transactions and their history are hard to trace and audit which in turn creates challenges around efficient 
compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations. On the opposite side, it is difficult for an institution to preserve the transaction privacy of parties without disclosing information to 
irrelevant counterparties. 

CrossPool presents an effective solution to this dilemma by running DABS and other security tokens natively listed on the platform following a binary model. This covers two modes: 
private state and public state.  

In private state, tokens will be circulated exclusively on the Corda distributed ledger. Information on Corda is only shared with those parties to a transaction and consensus is 
achieved when the signatures of the parties involved are presented. Corda is also built to facilitate auditability and traceability, notary nodes act as transactions validators and 
record keepers. In case a third party wants to verify a transaction for auditing purposes, this can be done via the notary node. To ensure the process is fully compliant, our built-in 
identity system in combination with Corda’s proprietary features will ensure transactions adhere to established legal standards.  

To enable a broader public circulation on a global scale as well as usage with public blockchain Dapps, private state tokens can be switched to public state by a mechanism of 1:1 pegging. 
Registered users are allowed to withdraw the tokens from CrossPool to public blockchains, such as Ethereum. Public blockchain users who are not registered can use a service provided by token 
brokers registered with the CrossPool platform. 

Please refer to chapter 4 – Technical Approach for more detailed information.

# 4. Technical approach 

## 4.1 CrossPool System Overview 

CrossPool aims to become an exchange of choice for originating, listing and trading cryptoassets or enterprise tokens with 
cross-chain interoperability and multi-venue connectivity.

CrossPool uses Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to fractionalise assets ownership, automate cashflows through smart contracts, 
increase security and transparency whilst simplifying what is today a cumbersome and documents intensive process spread across various intermediaries.

<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/xpoverview.png" />
</p>

Integrated with our existing CryptoFabrik cryptoassets trading platform, CrossPool will be a market place where cryptoasset liquidities across different 
channels are aggregated and matched and trades are settled immediately on a distributed ledger. This setup will help to avoid errors and improve the 
traditional disjoined lengthy processes of clearing, increase the ease of exchange and unlock asset ownership for more investors. 

On this single platform, CrossPool connects the common and sophisticated users, either directly or through an agency, offering, trading, 
investing and managing cryptoassets with minimum cost.  

CrossPool will also be connected with other cryptoassets trading venues, be it a centralised exchange, a de-centralised exchange or an 
Over-The-Counter (OTC) pool, to bring in additional liquidity, so that businesses and users of CrossPool can always trade on the best price of a 
cryptoasset or trade cryptoassets which are offered by other venues.   

CrossPool will be interoperable with other blockchains, public or permissioned, to achieve truly global cross-border movement and exchange of cryptoassets. 

## 4.2 CrossPool Ledger with Secure Distributed Storage System 

One of the two sub-components composed of CrossPool is the CrossPool Distributed Ledger (XPDL). The XPDL will be built on Corda and extend Cordite’s Distributed General Ledger 
model with a built-in secure distributed storage system, the CrossPool File System (XPFS). 

What is Corda? Corda 
>_“is a blockchain and smart contract platform. As a blockchain platform Corda allows parties to transact directly, with value. 
The key challenges for legacy blockchain technology are a lack of privacy and finality. Corda was designed to address these structural shortcomings creating a 
platform that enables private transactions with immediate finality”._[6,7]  

And Why we choose Corda? Because some specific aspects of Corda’s design make it an especially attractive target for cryptoasset issuances, as Richard Brown, 
CTO of R3, stated in his articles about asset tokenisation [8,9]:

- Settlement finality, which enables the real-world issuer to demonstrate compliance with associated finality regulations as well as to 
reduce their own risk stemming from blockchain “reorganisations” (fork) that can occur on other platforms. 
- Strong identity layer, which enables firms to know who is holding or has held tokens they have issued. Important when you care about staying compliant. 
- Universal interoperability design, which allows issuance of multiple different assets on the same network, enables sophisticated transaction types. 
- Many of the world’s largest financial institutions, who helped design Corda in the first place, are deploying production-quality Corda nodes.

Cordite is an open source project built on Corda that provides companies and corporations the distributed governance and economic services [10]. 
Particularly, the Distributed General Ledger provides a de-centralised way to manage accounts and issue tokens on Corda. 

What is XPFS? Distributed ledgers or blockchains are good for recording transactions or executing smart contracts, but a full business trade process is 
not just about transactions or executions, it requires other supportive information to complete the whole lifecycle of the data flow, such as trade 
counterparty identity proof, contracts, legal papers, ownership certificates and etc. These documents are normally presented and stored as images or 
large files, which are kept off-chain. Because of the distributed nature of the blockchain, we need a distributed file storage system accessible 
from every node of the blockchain network to upload or retrieve back files. Security and privacy are paramount attributes for financial transactions, 
therefore the distributed file storage system also needs to be securely guarded with proper level of access control.  

After a comprehensive analysis of the globally available network storage and security technologies by our technical and advisory team, we believe that 
the Cyber Mimic Defense [11] and the file storage system built on top this cutting-edge technology will fulfil CrossPool’s requirement for a blockchain 
integrated secure distributed storage system. Therefore, we choose to work with the award-winning R&D team from a Peking University key lab [12] to develop 
the XPFS. XPFS will be based on the existing patent obtained file storage solution and further enhanced by adding a built-in layer of 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) control to allow digitalised documents and certificates to be shared and accessed securely across the XPDL. 

On top of the XPFS, the XPDL will be running 4 groups of Corda nodes:

<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/xpfs.png" />
</p>

- **Token Registry Node:** issues cryptoasset tokens, eg. security tokens, crypto-coins, digital cash, virtual currency and distributed fees, according 
to the existing regulatory frameworks;  
- **Region Node:** manages registered user accounts from a specific region (e.g. a country or sovereign state, such as the US or China) to record, 
manage and execute smart contracts in perfect synchrony with other peers; 
- **Network Notary Node:** provides uniqueness consensus of all the XPDL transactions; 
- **Token Teller Node:** handles XPDL/public token swap. Each node will be responsible for a particular public blockchain, such as HyperLedger Fabric or Ethereum.

Tokens created and issued on the XPDL are CrossPool Asset Tokens (XPATs). These tokens will be operating in a XPDL to public swappable binary model. 
Comparing to the public coin model, the binary operating model will have the following benefits: 

- Restrict the XPAT circulation to trusted and authenticated users and have auditable track records of transactions for regulatory compliance; 
- Maintain the flexibility of swapping the XPAT out of XPDL to the public blockchains for broader public circulation or swapping the public blockchain 
tokens back into XPDL through monitored and controlled check-points; 
- Open up future opportunities to implement new features or improvement proposals, such as cross-chain atomic swap, inter-ledger token exchange etc. 

XPAT movements on XPDL with public token swaps are shown as follows: 
 
<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/xpbinary.png" />
</p>
 
- XPAT initially issued by the Token Registry Node onto the XPDL; 
- XPAT on XPDL are debited or credited between CrossPool user accounts, which are KYC/AML verified; 
- XPAT can be put into reserve in exchange for pegged public tokens, such as Ethereum ERC tokens, through a specific Token Teller Node; 
- Pegged public tokens then can be withdrawn by a CrossPool user account from the Token Teller Node out to the corresponding public blockchain to allow subsequent transfer to other public wallets; 
- Pegged public tokens can also be deposited into the Token Teller Node by a CrossPool registered user account in exchange for XPAT, which then will be unlocked and distributed back onto the XPDL.
 
## 4.3 CrossPool Hybrid Mode Trading 

The second sub-component composed of CrossPool is the CrossPool Trading System (XPTS).  

XPTS will be an upgraded version of our current product – CryptoFabrik. CryptoFabrik is our multi-venue cryptoassets trading platform. 
It provides a single interface into all your exchange accounts, gain unprecedented access to liquidity by trading on the aggregated price feeds from all major exchanges.  

CryptoFabrik currently has the following features: 

- Discover, compare and analyse prices and order book fundamentals for multiple exchanges in real-time; 
- Access aggregated market data and all your exchange accounts easily and in one place; 
- Use one unified and highly functional interface to cover your whole trading cycle, from research to executing orders, to tracking your holdings and performance; 
- View your consolidated portfolio of holdings, all transactions, and performance across different assets and trading venues in a consistent dashboard
 
There will be further developments of the CryptoFabrik to make XPTS a full-fledged exchange, by firstly adding matching engines; and secondly integrating post-trade 
Straight Through Process (STP) with XPDL.  

There are 3 types of cryptoasset exchanges in terms of matching and settlement behaviours: centralised exchange, de-centralised exchange and hybrid exchange. 
Centralised exchange is no difference to the traditional equity or forex exchanges, where orders are aggregated on centralised orderbooks and matched, then transactions are 
recorded as an entry within the exchange-controlled database. Only upon requested by the users, tokens will be moved out of the exchange and settled on the blockchain. 
In contrast, a de-centralised exchange is not in control of the orderbooks and settlement process. It uses bespoke protocol to facilitate the price discovery and help 
counterparties to transact with each other directly risk-free. Because all the orders are submitted on-chain by the users and trades are settled on-chain by smart contracts. 
But de-centralised exchange is not broadly adopted due to its lack of liquidity and issue of scalability. XPTS belongs to the third type of exchange, a hybrid exchange. 

The XPTS is operating in a hybrid mode with centralised orderbooks and matching followed by de-centralised settlement process:
 
<p  style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../../images/xpstp.png" />
</p>
 
- Users on different XPDL Region Nodes sends bid and ask orders to the centralised orderbook processed by the XPTS matching engine;  
- When bid and ask orders matched and trades occurred, trade details passed back to the corresponding XPDL Region Nodes that manages the corresponding buyers and sellers; 
- Post trade STP then will take place on the XPDL and be initiated by the Region Node managing the takers with the participants of the other Region Node managing the makers 
plus the Network Notary Node to achieve immediate post trade settlement.
  
CrossPool’s ultimate goal is to create a multi-chain interoperable, de-centralised exchange. With the current blockchain technology, there are limitations of a de-centralised 
exchange comparing to the traditional centralised exchange, such as latency of on-chain orderbook and support of advanced order types (e.g. iceberg orders). Therefore, 
a hybrid exchange will still keep the centralised exchange matching efficiency with the added benefit of faster and frictionless settlement. As the blockchain technology progresses, 
the CrossPool hybrid exchange could be further upgraded to a fully de-centralised exchange.

## 6.2 Token nature and application  

XPU is a utility token designed to support transactions on CrossPool platform. The token can be used to pay for services in the CrossPool platform including but not limited to asset origination, 
listing and trading. Business users of the CrossPool platform, asset owners, professional traders, wealth and Investment managers and token brokers, can select to pay using XPU or fiat. 
Holders of XPU will enjoy a time-bound discount when settling transaction fees with XPU. Exact details on discounts will be announced once the exchange is live. As the platform matures, 
we might introduce more services to the ecosystem, in which XPU will continue to serve as the primary platform token.  Non-holders of the XPU token will have access to all core features 
of the CrossPool platform, however will not enjoy the full benefits designed specifically for token holders.   

The XPU token will also be used to reward development activities and service contributions from third party service providers. For development activities CrossPool intends to create 
a community of developers, participants in the development community will be incentivized though bounties and rewards. Development contributions can be categorized into two groups. 

The first group includes direct contributions to the CrossPool platform such as bug fixes, performance improvements and the development of applications that provide additional 
functionalities to CrossPool platform. The second group includes development activities outside CrossPool platform, such as an XPU ERC token Dapp or any other application 
promoting the usage of the XPATs.  

Development activities within the two groups will be rewarded with XPU or XPU ERC tokens.  Public blockchain users and developers who are not registered with CrossPool but wish to 
exchange the XPU ERC token for fiat or other tokens can go to a registered CrossPool token broker. Both CrossPool registered and non-registered users can participate in development activities.  

The service contributions are not part of the development scheme and are defined as additional services such as custody, pricing services etc. provided by third parties. 
These services will integrate to CrossPool infrastructure. Service providers will be compensated with XPU tokens in exchange for their service. Service contributors will become a 
part of the ecosystem and need to go through CrossPool registration system. 

Investors will receive a paper certificate for the issuance of the XPU token as soon as the transactions is confirmed. Upon completion of the token sale, Investors will have the option 
to request the issuance of XPU ERC tokens equivalent to the XPU tokens. Once the CrossPool is live, token owners will have the option to swap the XPU ERC token for the XPU token and 
use it within the XP exchange or hold the XPU ERC tokens.  

All users participating in the private sale must go through the registration process. During the private sale the XPU token can be purchased using USD, once the CrossPool exchange is 
fully operational the XPU token will be available for purchase with ETH, BTC and fiat, the token is fully convertible to other listed tokens and cryptocurrencies. 

At the current stage we do not have plans to list the XPU token on any other exchanges. XPU tokens will not provide users with dividends or any other form or pay-outs and XPU tokens 
do not represent ownership or concede voting rights. 

## 6.3 Private offering process 
   
The private offer starts on 5th Nov 2018, and will run for a period of 3 months, or when the hardcap is reached, whichever happened first. 
   
Interested parties should register on our website first, after registration, we will do a pre-screening, and invite potential contributors by e-mail. At which point, 
investors should expect to go through a KYC/AML procedure prior to making the contribution.  
   
We anticipate to start token allocation in Q1 2019, and we will publish the exact date and all related details on our website.

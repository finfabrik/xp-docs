## DABS

> Digital Asset Backed Securities are the digital representations of real assets on the blockchain- Tokenised versions of assets that can be traded directly and immediately on digital exchanges, stored on digital wallets and exchanged for other asset tokens within the same or other asset classes.

## Binary-mode token

> Binary-mode token(s) are tokens that can exist either in private state or public state. 
Tokens in private state are circulated only on the permissioned Corda distributed ledger and can be transferred _out_ to a public blockchain by a mechanism of 1:1 pegging (e.g.  1 XPU token to 1 XPU ERC token). 
Tokens transferred out onto public blockchains are said to be in a public state.
